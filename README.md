# Ringer

Ringer is an easy-to-use Android widget that allows users to control their device's ringer mode and adjust volume seamlessly. The widget is built using [Jetpack Glance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/glance), providing a modern and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Ringer Mode Control**: Quickly switch between different ringer modes, such as silent, vibrate, and normal.
- **Volume Adjustment**: Easily adjust the device's volume directly from the widget.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed with a user-friendly interface for smooth navigation and usage.
- **Single Screen**: A single screen app to access the same functionality without using the widget. But I recommend using the widget since it's quick and intuitive üòÅ.
